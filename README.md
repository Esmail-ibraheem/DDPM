## Overview
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are a class of generative models that learn a diffusion process to generate samples. The model iteratively applies a diffusion process to noise, gradually transforming it into samples from the target distribution. This approach has shown promising results in generating high-quality images and has garnered attention in the field of generative modeling.
